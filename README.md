# Digital-Technologies
Hacka.py web-d project but got the topic wrong.

The main file is digital.html.
The project has been divide into different html, css and js files along with grouped folder for assets. All assets are of the internet, through free stock websites such as pexels.com and stock.adobe.com.
Any feedback is appreciated. However it has been long past this project and I am in development of others.
Thanks!
